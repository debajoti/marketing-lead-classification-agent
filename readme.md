# Agent Marketing â€“ Real Estate AI Sales Assistant

A Node.js web application that simulates a human-like AI sales agent for the real estate industry. The assistant interacts with users, gathers requirements, classifies leads (Hot, Cold, Invalid), and logs conversations and metadata to MongoDB.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engages users with context-aware questions about location, property type, budget, timeline, and purpose.
- **Lead Classification**: Automatically classifies leads as Hot, Cold, or Invalid based on user responses.
- **Logging**: Stores conversation transcripts and extracted metadata in MongoDB.
- **Web Interface**: Simple chat UI built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o for natural language understanding and response generation.
- **Extensible Tools**: Modular tool system for logging and future expansion.

## Project Structure

- **index.js**: Main server file (Express app, OpenAI integration, chat endpoint).
- **systemPrompts.js**: System prompt and classification logic for the AI agent.
- **tools.js**: Tool definitions (currently logging to MongoDB).
- **lib/connect.js**: MongoDB connection helper.
- **public/**: Static assets (chat UI, CSS, avatars).
- **log.txt**: Example of logged lead data (for reference).

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

     INDUSTRY=real estate
     ```

4. **Start the server**

   npm start
   ```

   The app will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
